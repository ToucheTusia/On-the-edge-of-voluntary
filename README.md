On the edge of voluntary

The “Loading” spinner, as others have noted(1), represents the decoupling of the stationary, waiting body and the online affect and activation. Once in, the online is a vast landscape that we traverse by clicks and scrolls seduced into thinking that our journey has a direction and with it a destination. A place where the glass membrane can be breached and we can connect with our desired and future forms, and with one another.

But, as we have known for a while, this space of togetherness is colonized and governed by monopolies that further our addictions to exchange of capital, filter us into bubbles of post-truth cultures, and surveil our every move for their own economic benefit (2). The promise of freedom turned us from a community into a network of competitors. Each streaming from our own channels, screaming for attention and connection from isolation.

The pandemic forced us into a physical isolation. What if our experience of distance and proximity between us was not defined by "poor" or "unstable" connection, the glitchy voice, and the blurry face? What if all of our scrolls, those tinniest of motions, were a call for kinship with those on the other side of the browser window and those in a building across the street? 

The undulations of this time, of data flows, made me often feel like I was sinking, but the current crisis also made me realize that the value of transmission is in circulation.  

I will try to carry this knowledge with me as we find ourselves on the precipice.
